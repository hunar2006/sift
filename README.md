# Sift

Sift orders repository diffs for review, with durable local decision history and keyboard-first undo/redo.

![Sift workbench][workbench]

## Install

Run:

```bash
npx siftdiff
```

Or install:

```bash
npm i -g siftdiff
```

## 60-second tour

- `sift` — review current changes.
- `sift last` — review the latest commit.
- `sift --watch` — refresh as it changes.
- `j` / `k` / `a` / `x` — move and decide.
- `sift tui` — review in a terminal.
- `sift demo` — try it without a repo.

## How we test Sift

Sift grades AI-written code, so the engine is graded too: a six-repo corpus (`pnpm eval`), hard invariants (including independent mechanical honesty), and a property fuzzer (`pnpm fuzz`). `pnpm health` additionally blocks unused code, circular imports, lint/type failures, and oversized initial JavaScript; `pnpm test:soak` repeats the full suite ten times. Run `pnpm preflight` for the complete release-readiness scorecard before shipping. Numbers and recommendations live in [docs/EVAL.md](docs/EVAL.md). Scoring weights stay frozen unless an invariant/spec bug is proven.

## Live mode and the fix loop

Start a local review companion for the working tree, or for Git's index:

```bash
sift --watch
# or
sift --staged --watch
```

Sift watches changes, re-runs the same review after a short debounce, and streams hunk deltas into the open browser. Existing decisions never change. A modified hunk gets a new ID and returns unreviewed, marked **fresh**; untouched approvals remain approved. The `New (n)` header button filters fresh hunks, and opening or deciding one clears its fresh marker.

```text
flag in Sift → sift brief | clip (or MCP) → agent fixes → fresh hunks return in watch mode
```

Use `sift brief` for flagged hunks, or `sift brief --unreviewed-high` for unreviewed high-risk work. It includes the reviewer note, primary reasons, and a patch capped at 120 lines per hunk.

## What it does

- **Digest:** factual, deterministic headlines and details for every hunk.
- **Triage:** logic, tests, config, dependencies, docs, mechanical, generated, and binary categories.
- **Risk:** inspectable deterministic reasons plus optional user rules.
- **Structure:** formatting detection, rename-pattern groups, definitions, references, and reading-order hints.
- **Coverage:** LCOV and Cobertura artifacts that you generated yourself.
- **Provenance:** Claude Code hook logs and compatible open JSONL records.
- **State:** approved, flagged, and unreviewed decisions stored locally under `.sift/`.
- **Word diff:** changed words are tinted within paired added/removed lines without disturbing monospace alignment.
- **Search:** Ctrl/Cmd+F finds literal text across paths, digests, and all diff lines.

### Risk signals

Directive comments are machine-read behavior changes, not bulk-approvable prose. Sift flags compiler, linter, coverage, formatter, and declaration-tooling suppressions (for example `@ts-ignore`, `# noqa`, and `//go:build`) as the primary `LINT_SUPPRESSED` signal whether they are added or removed, so they remain in the attention queue with the matched directive shown as evidence.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sift [range]` | Analyze the worktree or a ref/range and start the loopback UI. |
| `sift last [n]` | Review `HEAD~n..HEAD` (default: 1). |
| `sift --staged` | Analyze staged changes. |
| `sift --watch` | Keep the default worktree review live; it also works with `--staged`, not a ref range or PR. |
| `sift pr [number, URL, or owner/repo#number]` | Analyze a GitHub PR diff through `gh`. |
| `sift brief [--flagged\|--unreviewed-high] [-o file]` | Produce an agent-ready review handoff. |
| `sift report [--md\|--json\|--html] [-o file]` | Emit a report and append a stats snapshot; `--html` is one self-contained static file. |
| `sift print [--json]` | Print compact terminal triage without starting the server. |
| `sift stats [--json]` | Print review debt, progress, flags, and line-match coverage. |
| `sift check [--max-debt pct]` | Personal pre-push aid; not a team performance metric. |
| `sift demo [--dir path]` | Generate the demo repository and launch Sift. |
| `sift rules lint` / `sift rules list` | Validate and display the effective ruleset. |
| `sift init` | Write commented `.sift/config.json` and `.sift/rules.yml` starters if absent. |
| `sift mcp` | Serve read-only review context over stdio MCP tools. |
| `sift tui [range]` | Full-screen terminal review cockpit (Ink); same pipeline and `state.json` as the web UI. |
| `sift hooks install [--project]` | Install the Claude Code PostToolUse capture hook. |
| `pnpm shots` / `pnpm perf` / `pnpm pack-check` / `pnpm eval` / `pnpm fuzz` | Reproduce visual evidence, check the pipeline budget, verify an installed tarball, run the corpus eval, or property-fuzz the parser/pipeline. |

## Pull requests

Run `sift pr` to choose an open pull request, or pass its number, URL, or `owner/repo#number`. Use `sift report --pr 123 --md` for a PR report. Sift never posts; any `gh pr comment` command is yours to run.

## Terminal cockpit (`sift tui`)

Browser-averse path that shares the decision-core, digests, and `.sift/state.json` with the web UI.

```text
SIFT TUI FRAME · 34 hunks · 11 groups · debt 100%
[attention] High-risk logic (5)
[attention] Medium risk (15)
…
-- src/auth/session.ts · high 100 · Adds `rotateSessionRefresh()` (+7 lines)
footer: n of m · j/k move · a approve · x flag · u unreview · z undo · Shift+Z redo · R revert · q quit
```

Keys: `j`/`k` hunk · `g`/`G` first/last · `n`/`p` next/prev unreviewed attention · `a` approve · `x` flag (1–4 quick reasons, `i` note) · `u` unreview · `z` undo · `Shift+Z` redo · `A` group · `space` expand patch · `o` editor · `R` snapshot-backed file revert · `?` help · `q` quit (prints `sift print` summary). Prefer a terminal ≥100×28; 80×24 still works with truncation. Use `--watch` for live refreshes and `--print-frame` for CI smoke.

## Cockpit keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl/Cmd+K` | Open the command palette. |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+F` | Search paths, digest text, and diff lines. |
| `j` / `k`, `J` / `K` | Move by hunk, or by file. |
| `n` / `p` | Next / previous unreviewed attention hunk. |
| `a`, `x`, `u`, `z` | Approve, flag, unreview, or undo the last decision. |
| `Shift+Z`, `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z` | Redo the last decision. |
| `f` / `F` | Enter focus mode, or toggle flagged hunks only. |
| `e` | Open the current hunk at its first changed line in the configured editor. |
| `R` | Confirm a snapshot-backed revert of the current file in a WORKTREE/STAGED review. |
| `i`, `space`, `s` | Focus note, collapse hunk, or cycle sort order. |
| `t`, `T`, `?` | Open timeline, toggle theme, or open help. |

In focus mode the action row is `[a] Approve` `[x] Flag` `[j] Skip` `[z] Undo` `[R] Revert` `[e] Open in editor`; `Esc` returns to the workbench. The **New (n)** header button filters fresh hunks.

## Change digests and the summary stack

Every hunk carries a factual digest computed deterministically in core. Understanding arrives in a labeled stack:

- **auto**: deterministic digest (headline and details), always present.
- **agent**: when provenance matches, the Intent block shows what was asked and the agent reasoning excerpt.
- **AI**: with `--ai`, an optional second headline line labeled `AI · <provider>`.

Sift **describes, never judges**. It informs the decision; you make it.

### Flag reasons and editor jump

Quick-flag reasons default to `Needs tests`, `Security concern`, `Doesn't match intent`, and `Unnecessary change`. Override them in `.sift/config.json`:

```json
{ "flagReasons": ["Needs tests", "Perf risk", "Out of scope"] }
```

Set a known editor ID or a safe argument template in that same file:

```json
{ "editor": "code" }
```

```json
{ "editor": "subl %f:%l" }
```

Sift resolves the selected hunk server-side and launches only the configured editor (or detected `code`/`cursor`) through `execFile` with an argument array. It never opens a shell or executes anything from the reviewed repository.

## Rules, coverage, provenance, and MCP

Rules load from `~/.sift/rules.yml` and then `<repo>/.sift/rules.yml`, with repo rules winning. See [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md).

Sift never executes repository tests, scripts, or configs. It only parses LCOV and Cobertura artifacts you already produced; pass `--coverage <path>` when autodetection is not right.

`sift hooks install` merges a Claude Code PostToolUse hook into settings and writes compact provenance metadata to `~/.sift/provenance.jsonl`. On Windows, the default settings file is `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`; use `sift hooks install --project` for repo-local settings. See [docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md).

`sift mcp` serves read-only stdio tools and **refreshes mid-session** when the worktree fingerprint changes, so the flag→agent→fix loop works without restarting the server. It has no write tools and accepts only IDs/enums as inputs. See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

## Optional AI

`--ai`, `--ai=cross`, `--ai=same`, `--ai=both`, `--ai=anthropic`, or `--ai=openai` adds annotation-only summaries for high and medium risk hunks. Secret-like hunks are excluded from provider payloads. AI output never changes score, category, order, grouping, or status.

## Security and privacy

- Offline-first by default; no telemetry or analytics.
- Sift never runs reviewed repository code.
- Git access is read-only except an explicitly confirmed file revert. Revert is limited to WORKTREE/STAGED, snapshots the current bytes in Git first, and never stages, commits, pushes, or bulk-reverts.
- The web server binds `127.0.0.1` only.
- Web and grammar assets are bundled from disk; nothing is fetched at runtime.
- Network is limited to localhost and explicit `--ai` provider calls.
